# Mirage - Rogue LDAP Server for Pass-back Attacks  

Mirage is a rogue LDAP server designed to perform LDAP Pass-back attacks against misconfigured network devices, such as printers. By altering a device‚Äôs LDAP configuration to point to Mirage, authentication attempts can be intercepted to extract credentials.

## üìå How It Works  
1. **Gain Access** - Obtain access to a device‚Äôs LDAP configuration (e.g., a printer‚Äôs web interface).  
2. **Modify LDAP Server** - Change the LDAP server IP/hostname to point to Mirage.  
3. **Trigger Authentication** - Test the LDAP configuration to force an authentication attempt.  
4. **Intercept Credentials** - Mirage captures and logs the authentication request, revealing credentials.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup  
### Requirements  
- Docker  
- Python 3.x  
- `ldap3` and `scapy` (Install via `pip install ldap3 scapy`)  

### Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mirage.git  
cd mirage  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
## Running with Docker
Mirage comes with a Dockerfile that sets up an OpenLDAP server inside a container.

### What the Dockerfile Does
1. Uses Debian as the base image.
2. Installs OpenLDAP (slapd) and LDAP utilities.
3. Configures the LDAP server to work without manual setup.
4. Exposes port 389, which is used for LDAP authentication.
5. Runs an entrypoint script (entrypoint.sh) to start the LDAP server.
