# Mirage - Rogue LDAP Server for Pass-back Attacks  
Mirage is a rogue LDAP server designed to perform LDAP Pass-back attacks against misconfigured network devices, such as printers. By altering a device‚Äôs LDAP configuration to point to Mirage, authentication attempts can be intercepted to extract credentials.  
---

## üìå How It Works  
1. **Gain Access** - Obtain access to a device‚Äôs LDAP configuration (e.g., a printer‚Äôs web interface).  
2. **Modify LDAP Server** - Change the LDAP server IP/hostname to point to Mirage.  
3. **Trigger Authentication** - Test the LDAP configuration to force an authentication attempt.  
4. **Intercept Credentials** - Mirage captures and logs the authentication request, revealing credentials.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup  
### Installation  
#### Running with Docker
Mirage comes with a Dockerfile that sets up an OpenLDAP server inside a container.
```bash
docker build -t mirage .
docker run --name mirage --privileged -p 389:389 -d mirage
```

### What the Dockerfile Does
- Installs OpenLDAP (slapd) and LDAP utilities.
- Configures the LDAP server to work without manual setup(Uses Plain text authentication and no ecnryption).
- Exposes port 389, which is used for LDAP authentication.
- Runs an entrypoint script (`entrypoint.sh`) to start the LDAP server.
- Runs the TCPdump to fetch credentials and save it to text file.

## Testing the Server
To ensure the LDAP server is running and configured properly, you can use the test scripts inside the ldap_tests/ folder.
### Run LDAP Test Scripts
Navigate to the ldap_tests/ directory and run the test script:
```bash
cd ldap_tests  
python ldap_test.py
```

## Future Plans
As part of ongoing improvements to this project, I plan to move away from using the TCPDump proxy and instead fetch credentials directly from LDAP. This will fetch the credentials accuratly from the ldap server than relating something in the middle to do the job. This future update aims to improve accuracy and performance.
